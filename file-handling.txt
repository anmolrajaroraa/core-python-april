File Handling

1. Read - r
- File will be opened for reading the data only
- File should exist otherwise some exception will be thrown
- Writing is not allowed when file is open in only read mode

2. Write - w
- Open a file with the name specified and write the data from the first line in that file (truncate the existing data if file already exists)

3. Append - a
- Open a file with the name specified
- If file does not exists then a new file will be created (same as write mode)
- If file exists then data will not be truncated, new data to be written will be added to the end of the file

4. r+
- Follow the same rules as r mode, plus you can write some data also

5. w+
- Follow the same rules as w mode, plus you can read some data also

6. a+
- Follow the same rules as a mode, plus you can read some data also
